description="CLI-based Runtime testing framework for Godot 4.x. Run any Godot scene from the command line and inject test behavior at runtime. Set properties, call methods, emit signals, capture signal emissions, and assert expectations—all without touching your source files. Get structured output (`[RT:OK]`, `[RT:ERR]`, `[RT:PASS]`, `[RT:FAIL]`) that's easy to parse and act on."
